# Basic Problems

Toxic Effects of Copper and Zinc. Reconsider the data in Display 10.20 (file: ex1014). (a) Is
the experiment a randomized block design or a completely randomized design with factorial treatment
structure? (b) Analyze the data using two-way analysis of variance. (c) How does the analysis
of variance compare to the regression analysis (i.e., what are the issues in deciding which analysis is
more appropriate)?
```{r}
#Read-In the data
minnow <- Sleuth3::ex1014

#take a look at the dataset 
head(minnow)

#turn copper and zinc into factors 
minnow <- minnow %>%
  mutate(Copper = as.factor(Copper), 
         Zinc = as.factor(Zinc))


#look at the boxplots 
p1 <- minnow %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(Copper), y = Protein)) + 
  labs(x = "Copper") + 
  theme_classic()

p2 <- minnow %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = as.factor(Zinc), y = Protein)) + 
  labs(x = "Zinc", y = "") + 
  theme_classic()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)



# REGRESSION ANALYSIS
#running the full model 
minnow_lm <- lm(Protein ~ Copper + Zinc, data = minnow) #when I included the interaction term it wasn't really running the subsequent code well 
anova(minnow_lm)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(minnow_lm)

summary(minnow_lm)


# ANOVA ANALYSIS 
minnow_aov <- aov(Protein ~ Copper + Zinc, data = minnow)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(minnow_aov)

summary(minnow_aov)


```

The experiment is a completely randomized design with factorial treatment structure.

El Ni ˜no and Hurricanes. Reconsider the El Ni˜no and Hurricane data set from Exercise 10.28.
(a) Regress the log of the storm index on West African wetness (treated as a categorical factor with
2 levels) and El Ni˜no temperature (treated as a categorical factor with 3 levels); retain the sum of
squared residuals and the residual degrees of freedom. (b) Regress the log of the storm index onWest
African wetness (treated as categorical with 2 levels), El Ni˜no temperature (treated as numerical),
and the square of El Ni˜no temperature. Retain the sum of squared residuals and the residual degrees
of freedom. (c) Explain why the answers to (a) and (b) are the same. (d) Explain why a test that
the coefficient of the temperature-squared term is zero can be used to help decide whether to treat
temperature as numerical or categorical.

## 13.17
Dinosaur Extinctions—An Observational Study. About 65 million years ago, the dinosaurs
suffered a mass extinction virtually overnight (in geologic time).What happened in this period, the
Cretaceous–Tertiary (KT) boundary, that could have produced such calamity? Among many clues,
one that all scientists regard as crucial is a layer of iridium-rich dust that was deposited over much of
the earth at that time. Data from one of the first discoveries of this layer are shown inDisplay 13.22.
The diagram traces iridium concentrations in soil samples taken from extensive shale and limestone
deposits at Gubbio, Italy. Iridium (parts per trillium) is graphed against the depth at which samples
were taken, with depth giving a crude measure of historic time.

Iridium is a trace element present in most soils. But concentrations as high as those at the peak
near 347 meters, at the KT boundary, can only occur in association with highly unusual events, such
as volcanic eruptions or meteor impacts. So the theory is that such an event caused a massive dust
cloud that blanketed the earth for years, killing off animals and their food sources. Butwas the cause a
meteor (coming down on the Yucatan peninsula in central America) or volcanic eruptions (centered
in southern China)? Two articles debating the issue appeared in the October 1990 issue of Scientific
American—W. Alvarez and F. Asaro, “What Caused the Mass Extinction? An Extraterrestrial
Impact,” Scientific American 263(4): 76–84, and E. Courtillot, “What Caused the Mass Extinction?
A Volcanic Eruption,” Scientific American 263(4): 85–93. A crucial issue in the debate is the shape
of the iridium trace because the timing and extent of the source give clues to its nature.

The raw data are provided in Display 13.23. (a) Fit the two-way, saturated model to the untransformed
data and draw a plot of the residuals versus estimated means to see if a transformation
is suggested. (b) Fit the two-way model (after transformation if appropriate) and test for interaction,
using a multiple regression routine. (c) If appropriate with your statistical software, repeat part
(b) using an analysis of variance routine.

##13.21
Pygmalion. The term Pygmalion effect (used in the Section 13.1.2 data problem) originated
with the 1960s’ work of psychologist Robert Rosenthal and elementary school principal Lenore
Jacobson, who conducted a randomized block experiment on the children in Jacobson’s elementary
school. In each classroom (i.e., for each block of students), they assigned roughly 20% of the
students to a “likely to excel” treatment group and the remainder to a control group. After all students
took a standardized test at the begining of the school year, Rosenthal and Jacobson identified
to teachers those students that had been indicated by the intelligence test as very likely to excel in
the coming year. This was false information, though. The “likely to excel” students were simply
those who had been assigned by a chance mechanism to the “likely to excel” treatment group. The
researchers deceived the teachers with this false information to create artificial expectations and to
explore the effect of those expectations on student test score gains. Display 13.26 is a partial listing
of a data set simulated to match the summary statistics and conclusions from Table A-7 of Rosenthal
and Jacobson’s report (R. Rosenthal, and L. Jacobson, 1968, Pygmalion in the Classroom: Teacher
Expectation and Pupil’s Intellectual Development, Holt, Rinehart, andWinston, Inc.). Analyze the
data to summarize the evidence that teachers’ expectations affect student test score gains. Write a
statistical report of your conclusions.
