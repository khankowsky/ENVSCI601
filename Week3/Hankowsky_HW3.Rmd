# Basic Problems 

## 4.28
```{r}
#pulling the data from the 'Sleuth 3' package 
seedling <- Sleuth3::ex0428

#transposing the data so it is in long format
seedling_long <- seedling %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Cross, Self), 
               names_to = "Pollination", 
               values_to = "Height") %>%
  mutate(Pollinatio = as.factor(Pollination))

#creating a new variable 
seedling <- seedling %>%
  mutate(diff = Cross - Self)

```

##### A
```{r}
#histogram of the difference in seedling height 
seedling %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = diff)) +
  labs(title = "Seedling Height Difference",
       x = "Difference in Seedling Height",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_classic()
```

##### B 
```{r}
t1 <- t.test(Height ~ Pollination, data = seedling_long, paired = TRUE)
t1
```

##### C 
```{r}

```

##### D
```{r}

```

##### E
