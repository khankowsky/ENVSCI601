```

<br>

These results provide overwhelming evidence that the odds of infantile paralysis are lower for those who received the Salk vaccine (one-sided p-value < 0.0001). The odds of infantile paralysis are 2.54 times greater for the placebo treatment than the Salk vaccine (95% CI: 1.94 to $\infty$). Yes, the observed proportion in the control group is drastically larger than would be excepted under the null hypothesis (one-sided p-value < 0.0001).

## 19.23

Who Looks After the Kids? Exercises 10.31 and 17.13 considered data on clutch volume and
body mass to investigate the similarities of dinosaurs with several groups of currently living animals.
One issue concerning the validity of the study is the selection of the bird species in the set of currently
living animals. Were species (i) selected at random? (ii) stratified by group and selected within group
at random? (iii) selected based on what information was available? or (iv) selected to support the
study conclusions? Ignore the possibility of (iv). If the answer is (i) or (ii) then that would not cause
any problem with the analyses performed, but (iii) could potentially result in biased sampling and
therefore incorrect conclusions. Furthermore, (iii) seems like themost probable form of sampling of
the modern groups and almost certainly the form of sampling among the dinosaur groups. 

One way
to assess the likelihood (iii) for birds is to compare the numbers of species from each of the 29 orders
in the study with the known total number of species in each of the orders, as shown in Display 19.14.
If the selection of birds had been at random, the expected proportion of species in the study from one
particular order, n, is the proportion of all species in that order (N=9,866) times the total number of
species in the sample (414). That is, the expected number in each sample, if random sampling were
used, is .N=9,866/ ! 414. Calculate the expected numbers and compare the observed numbers with
them using Pearsonâ€™s chi-square statistic. It will have 29 " 1 D 28 d.f. What do you conclude?

```{r}
#Read-In the data
birds <- Sleuth3::ex1923

birds1 <- birds %>%
  mutate(expected_n = (N/9866)*414) %>%
  mutate(x = ((n-expected_n)^2)/expected_n) %>%
  mutate(x2 = sum(x))

chisq.test(birds1$expected_n, birds1$n)


fisher.test(birds1$expected_n, birds1$n)
```

These results provide moderate evidence that the odds of having 5 arrests or more are lower for those who participated in high-quality preschool programs (one-sided p-value = 0.042). The odds of having 5 arrests or more are 2.23 times less for participants in the high-quality preschool programs (95% CI: 1.01 to 5.04). These results provide solid evidence that the odds of having an annual income of $20K or more are greater for those who participated in high-quality preschool programs (one-sided p-value = 0.029). The odds of having an annual income 20K or more are 2.33 times greater for the participants in the high-quality preschool programs (95% CI: 1.06 to 5.24).

These data provide strong evidence that women were more likely to complete the diet study (p-value < 0.0063). The odds of completing the diet study were 9.42 times greater for woman than men (95% CI: 1.52 to 388.94).
